# Introduction

This is a simple BMI tracker app which I developed specifically for my Flutter workshop students. It is by no means perfect and the code structure may need some tweaking to make it follow the clean code principles fully.

## Features included in the app

1. Clean UI
2. Proper app folder structures
3. Persistent database (HIVE) and CRUD manipulation (unfortunately update data was not included in this app)
4. State management using riverpod (provider)
5. Navigations
6. Use of alert dialogs
7. Use of model classes and implementing certain methods for the class object
8. Use of ListView.builder to build a lazy list
9. Modifying the theme style at MaterialApp (top parent) level to ensure consistent appearance throughout the app by default
